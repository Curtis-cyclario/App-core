# \[Multi-person\] Pose estimation

## Description

The problem of pose estimation is formulated as localizing
anatomical keyparts in photos of people.
Most of the current effort is focused on **multi-person pose estimation**:
inference of the poses of multiple people in images in the most general environments.

Describe the usual evaluation procedure, main metrics and specify,
if needed, the metrics for each dataset.
