Create VertiCore Control Application Remake
Objective: Develop a robust, clean, and enhanced remake of the "VertiCore Control" IoT dashboard application. The original prototype (AeroGrow-IoT) provides a base, but this version should have improved code quality, structure, stability, and incorporate foundational elements for future expansion based on VertiCore Labs' focus on integrated urban sustainability systems.

Core Technology Stack:

Frontend: React (using functional components and hooks) with Vite as the bundler.
Backend: Node.js with Express and the ws library for WebSocket communication.
Styling: CSS (as per App.css), supporting both light and dark modes.
Charting: Chart.js (using react-chartjs-2).
PDF Generation: jsPDF with jspdf-autotable.
Key Features to Implement:

Modular Dashboard (CustomDashboard.jsx):

Display real-time sensor data: Temperature, Humidity, Water Level, Nutrient Level, Light Intensity. 
Include placeholders for future sensors (pH, CO2, Airflow).
Show system performance metrics (e.g., Uptime, Efficiency).
Implement a notification/alert section. 
Provide quick action buttons (e.g., Sync Data, Generate Report).
Device Management & Control (DevicesPage.jsx, DeviceControl.jsx, IoTIntegration.jsx):

List connected IoT devices (Sensors, Pumps, Lights, Controllers) with status (Online, Offline, Warning). 
Allow manual control (toggle on/off) for actuators like pumps and lights.
Implement scheduling capabilities for lights and pumps (interval/duration).
Include nutrient dosing control (manual and scheduled).
Display device details, health metrics (CPU, Memory, Temp, Signal Strength), and basic diagnostics.
Basic IoT integration framework to connect and manage devices, potentially supporting MQTT, HTTP protocols.
Plant Management (PlantManagement.jsx):

Allow users to add, view, and manage plants within the system (specify type, position, planted date).
Assign and display basic growing plans (Nutrient level, Light hours, Watering frequency) per plant.
Include a plant search/filter functionality.
Growing Plans (GrowingPlans.jsx):

Generate recommended growing plans based on plant type and potentially environmental factors (e.g., season, current sensor data).
Allow users to create, save, and apply custom growing plans.
Data Visualization (DataVisualization.jsx, LiveChart.jsx):

Display historical sensor data using line charts. 
Implement time range selection (e.g., 24h, 7d, 30d).
Ensure charts are interactive (zoom/pan).
Network Topology (NetworkTopology.jsx):

Visualize the network of connected devices (Control Hub, Towers, Sensors, Actuators).
Show connection status/health between devices.
Display real-time network stats (Latency, Packet Loss, Bandwidth).
Include interactive elements (node selection for details).
Fix the previously identified "Identifier 'handleNodeClick' has already been declared" error.
Reporting (MaintenanceReports.jsx, reportService.js):

Generate PDF reports for:
System Health (component status, overall score, recommendations).
Maintenance History & Predictions.
System Efficiency (resource usage comparison).
Provide options to preview or download reports.
AI Plant Assistant (AIPlantAssistant.jsx):

Implement a basic chat interface.
Provide simple, rule-based responses to common plant health/care questions (similar to the prototype).
Display basic plant health insights and recommendations based on simulated analysis. 
Real-time Communication (server.js, websocketService.js):

Establish a reliable WebSocket connection between frontend and backend.
Backend should simulate sensor data updates and push them to connected clients.
Handle client commands (pump/light control) sent from the frontend.
Implement basic connection handling, ping/pong, and reconnection logic.
UI/UX & General:

Implement responsive design for desktop and mobile views (MobileOptimization.jsx). 
Support light and dark themes (ThemeCustomizer.jsx).
Ensure intuitive navigation (desktop nav, mobile side menu/bottom bar). 
Display offline status indication (OfflineIndicator.jsx).
Use clear visual indicators for device/system status (Online, Offline, Warning, Critical).
Code Quality & Structure:

Clean Code: Ensure code is well-organized, readable, and follows standard JavaScript/React conventions. Use functional components and hooks.
Modularity: Structure the application into reusable components. 
Error Handling: Implement basic error handling, especially for backend communication and device control. Fix the "return outside of function" error in App.jsx.
Comments: Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
State Management: Use appropriate React state management (e.g., Context API or Zustand/Redux if complexity warrants it, although useState/useReducer might suffice initially).
Future Considerations (Foundation):

Expandability: Design with modularity to potentially integrate other VertiCore systems later (e.g., mining data, PCB refining metrics). 
Closed-Loop Foundation: While full automation isn't required now, structure data flow to potentially support future closed-loop feedback between systems. 
AI/ML Ready: Structure data and components to facilitate easier integration of more advanced AI/ML models later (predictive maintenance, video analysis). 
Sustainability Metrics: Include placeholders or simple tracking for resource usage (water, energy) to align with VertiCore's goals. 
Deliverable: A functional React application runnable on Replit, based on the provided structure but with improved code quality, fixed errors, and incorporating the features outlined above. The backend should simulate data realistically for demonstration purposes.
