Replit Coder Agent Enhancement Prompt

Objective: Enhance the Replit Coder Agent by fixing and completing the notifications dropdown and pop-ups, addressing bugs throughout the application, and implementing modern, visually appealing design elements to elevate the user experience.

Tasks:





Notifications Dropdown and Pop-ups:





Fix any issues with the notifications dropdown, ensuring it displays correctly, is responsive, and handles all notification types (e.g., success, error, info).



Complete the implementation of pop-up notifications, ensuring they are non-intrusive, dismissible, and consistent with the app’s design language.



Ensure smooth animations for dropdown and pop-up transitions (e.g., slide-in, fade-in).



Test for edge cases, such as rapid notification triggers or overflow scenarios.



Bug Fixes:





Identify and resolve bugs across the application, including but not limited to UI glitches, broken functionality, and performance issues.



Ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).



Fix any issues with state management or data persistence that may affect user interactions.



Modern Visual Design:





Update the UI with a modern, clean aesthetic, incorporating trends such as minimalism, smooth gradients, or neumorphism where appropriate.



Use a consistent color palette (e.g., modern pastel or dark mode themes) and typography that aligns with current design standards.



Add subtle animations and micro-interactions (e.g., hover effects, button transitions) to enhance user engagement.



Ensure accessibility compliance (e.g., sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation support).

Deliverables:





Fully functional notifications dropdown and pop-up system.



A bug-free application with improved performance and reliability.



A visually stunning, modern UI that enhances the user experience while maintaining usability and accessibility.

Constraints:





Maintain compatibility with Replit’s existing tech stack and infrastructure.



Ensure changes do not degrade performance or introduce new bugs.



Follow Replit’s branding guidelines for consistency.
